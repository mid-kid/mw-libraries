/*
 * The __MSL__ identifier is a hex value tracking, more or less,
 * a decimal identity - that is, for builds 10 - 16, we will use a
 * decimal appearing number.
 *
 * The __MSL__ identifier is broken up into three parts:  the major
 * version number, a zero (for backwards compatibility with older
 * version of the __MSL__ identifier), and the minor version number.
 *
 * The major version number takes the first five positions, the
 * zero is in the sixth position, and the minor version number is in
 * the final two positions; therefore: 0x000008001 means the major
 * MSL version is 8, and the minor version is 1.  This translates to
 * mean that MSL is the 8.1 version.
 *
 * The identifier is monotonically increasing for each build.
