The ARM_EABI_Support_DS2.0 directory provides the MSL C libraries for 
the DS2.0 release for use by the DSi toolset. It is provided for backward 
compatibility with CW for NINTENDO DS2.0 but it is not supported as part of 
the CW for NINTENDO DSi release package.

It is known that ANSI 'time' function support is disabled in this
MSL_C DS2.0 release.
